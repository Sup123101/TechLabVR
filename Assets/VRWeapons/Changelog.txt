------------------------------------------------
v2.02
------------------------------------------------
	Fixed some issues with VRTK AutoGrab not working correctly

	Using Generic Interaction System, weapons were able to be fired without picking them up, and was causing problems. Fixed.

	Added a Fire Selector visual indicator. Add the "FireSelectRotator" script to your fire selector, and assign the positions, and you're good to go.	

------------------------------------------------
v2.01
------------------------------------------------
	Fixed some issues with the bolt controller not functioning properly.

	Added a fire selector, and modifiable touchpad/button controls to the controllers. For VRTK, new options are found on the VRW_ControllerActions_VRTK script to assign them. For non-VRTK,
	they can be found on the VRW_GenericIS_Controller script, on the controllers themselves.

	New tutorial video is out: https://youtu.be/SnPY38CZ9UU

------------------------------------------------
v2.00
------------------------------------------------
	Huge changes!

	** NOTE: Weapons built in versions prior to 2.00 will need to be rebuilt! **

	I've rebuilt VRWeapons from scratch. It now functions in a much more modular, flexible way, instead of basically all being crammed into one script. Each piece uses an interface, making it
	easy to create custom behavior if desired. Those are found in the Assets/VRWeapons/Scripts/Interfaces folder. Additionally, VRWeapons is now fully integrated with VRTK, making for
	much more robust interaction mechanics. By default, VRW is not using VRTK interactions, but you can use the VRTK interaction pack by unpacking the VRW_VRTK_InteractionSystem.unitypackage
	to your project. For those not using VRTK - don't fret, I have also built a generic interaction system for any other cases. I will be adding more specific interaction systems 
	in the future, next up is InstantVR. 
	As far as features added - it is now possible to load magazines with individual rounds, and weapons are able to utilize individual bullet behavior (for example, if you want every 
	5th round to fire a tracer, simply load your magazines in-editor [or in-game!] with the appropriate bullet objects). 
	The most significant feature addition (in my opinion, anyway) is a full event system. Events are fired on every major weapon action, which allows for further expansion and flexibility,
	if required by the user.
	
------------------------------------------------
v1.25
------------------------------------------------
	Added Ejector randomness sliders, to add some variety to how shells are ejected. Find the new sliders in the Manual Slide Manipulation window!
	Weapons now have the option to kick back, as well as simply rotational. Additionally, weapons held in 2 hands will now kick, but significantly less than 1-handed.
	Added a new ImpactProfileOverride script that can be attached to a GameObject with a collider (but no mesh) to instruct it on what impact it should use, instead of the default.
	Fixed an issue where, if a weapon is held in 2 hands and the main hand is released, the weapon flies off.
	Guns with infinite ammo should now eject rounds properly.
	
------------------------------------------------
v1.24
------------------------------------------------
	Hey guys! Some good stuff with this update - added 5 sample weapons! These were commissioned from Bluesu, he has quite a few nice low-poly weapons packs. Find him here:
	https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/search/page=1/sortby=popularity/query=publisher:11491
	I asked him specifically to make certain types of weapons, each of them showing different features found in VRW. Feel free to use them, or just look into their building options 
		to build similar weapons of your own.
	Other than that - This update was focused on bug fixes. Not a whole lot new, this time. 

------------------------------------------------
v1.23
------------------------------------------------
	So I accidentally broke some people's projects once I moved to the SteamVR Interaction System, and now I'm here to fix it. VRTK mode now works. If you are using the [CameraRig] 
		prefab, make sure you hit the "VRTK Mode" toggle in VRWeapons.VRWControl. This update is mainly focused on fixing VRTK issues.

	- Added a line renderer for bullet shots, found on the Weapon inspector when "Bullet", "Auto Fire" or "Burst Fire" firemodes are selected.
	
	As usual, if there are any issues with the new VRTK implementation please let me know so I can get it fixed. I have checked for bugs as well as I can, but I rely on your bug 
		reports to track down the issues I'm not able to find. Email me here: slayd7@gmail.com 

------------------------------------------------
v1.22
------------------------------------------------
	Figured I'd start a changelog! I really should have done this a long time ago. 1.22 brings a lot of changes, some of which may break some projects. If there are any problems,
		or you just want to go back to 1.21, send me an email at Slayd7@gmail.com, and I'll send you 1.21. I understand not everyone will want to upgrade to 1.22; however, I believe
		it's worth it to move up. So, on to the changes:

	- VRW now uses the Steam Interaction System. I felt that my interaction system wasn't reliable enough, so the entire pack has been converted over. What this means to you: 
		If you have a [CameraRig] prefab in your scene, you'll need to change it out to a Player prefab, found in the latest SteamVR pack at SteamVR->InteractionSystem->Core->Prefabs.
		My viveCharControl.cs script is no longer used as a result, and InitializeControllers.cs has been changed to VRWeapons.VRWControl.cs. 

	- Guns built with earlier versions of VRWeapons will need to be rebuilt, because of the following changes:
	
	- Weapon kick has been changed, now uses physics instead of lerping movement. This should fix the strange behavior caused whe moving weapons quickly, feels more realistic, and has 
		the added bonus of 1-handed shooting having significantly more kick than 2-handed shooting.

	- Manual slide manipulation has been completely overhauled. It now uses the SteamVR Interaction System's Linear Drive to drive bolt movement. By the time this update is pushed to the 
		store, there will be a video up on my channel explaining how to set up bolt manipulation. It now includes the ability to rotate bolts before pulling them out, specifically to use 
		for weapons like bolt-action rifles. In addition, you can set the bolt movement to be separate from the charging handle, inspired by the functionality of AR15 charging handles. In 
		addition, you can now see if a weapon is loaded with the "Bullet shell" and "Unspent round" options in the builder. Again, this will be explained in the video, my channel is found 
		here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChC2f8-8uX5E0BBYBrLP3Gw

	- Shell and unspent round ejection has been moved to the slide manipulation window, in order to correctly set where rounds sit on the bolt face.

	- There is a new VRWAttachment script for weapon attachments, which is a barebones event system set up so you can use your own scripts. I am including a couple examples, a flashlight, 
		which you can turn on and off by putting a hand over the attachment and pulling the trigger, and a scope with an adjustable zoom, operated in the same way. There is a "push and hold" 
		functionality that you can implement your own function with as well, giving the option to have 2 functions on one attachment.

	- A new button, "Add VRWInteractableWeapon Script," has been added. I put this in because it's now possible to use a weapon as an attachment for another weapon, inspired by the M203 
		underbarrel grenade launcher. If the weapon you are building is NOT an attachment weapon, push that button to make it a standalone weapon.

	- Automatic projectile fire mode has been added. Behaves just like automatic fire, but fires projectiles instead of raycast bullets.

	- For now, in VRWeapons.VRWControl the "Allow swapping hands" button and the 'Grab on Start" options have been disabled. I'm having some issues implementing these with the new interaction system, 
		but expect a fix in a future update.
